- Linear Independance

  => $C_1V_1 + C_2V_2 + \cdots + C_nV_n = 0$

  <=> $C_1=C_2=\cdots = C_n=0$

  => Any vector $V_k$ can not be expressed by the other vectors



- Spaning

  => Set of vectors constructs a vector space by linear combinations

  => The set of vectors span the vector space



- If given linearly independent vectors,

  => linear combination => unique



- Basis(set of vectors)

  => minimum of vectors to span

  ​	a vector space

  => maximum # of linearly independent vectors



- Dimension of vector space

  = # of linearly independent vectors

- Rank(r) of A

  = # of independent column vectors

  = # of independent row vectors

  = # of pivots in GE



### 4 fundemental Subspaces in A

- Column Space : linear combinations of column vectors
- Null space: {$X|AX=0$} $\in R^n$
- Row space: linear combination of row vectors
- Left null space: {$y|A^Ty=0$} $\in R^n$



### Existence of Inverses

- Square case
- $Amxn , m<n \rightarrow$ Right inverse
- $Amxn, m>n \rightarrow$ Left inverse

### Linear Transformation

$AX = b$

=> System equation $X$ = solution

=> linear combination of column vectors



- Transformation

$R^n \rightarrow R^m$



- If given $AX$ for every basis vectors $X$

  $AX_1 = a_1$

  $AX_2 = a_2$

  $\cdots$

  $AX_n = a_n$

  than, we can find any transform results in the vector space without $A$

  => $y=C_1X_1 + C_2X_2 + \cdots + C_nX_n$

  $Ay = C_1AX_1 + C_2AX_2 + \cdots + C_nAX_n$



- How to find A?

  => If we know the $AX$ for the elementary basis vectors
